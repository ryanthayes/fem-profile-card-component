## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that you can have two background images at the same time and that you can position them independently.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
 background-image: 
    url(images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
    background-position: right 40vw bottom 40vh, left 40vw top 40vh;
```
